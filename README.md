# An Analysis of Vibrating Euler-Bernoulli Beams, TU Berlin, SS2021
### Sergi Andreu, Dylan Everingham, Carsten van de Kamp, Sebastian Myrb√§ck
Project course in numerical analysis, on the topic of FEM simulation of the bending of beams using Bernoulli theory.

### Structure

* The full report pdf is found [here](Report/Report_Numerical_Analysis_of_Vibrating_Beams.pdf). 
* The python code and Juptyer notebooks can be found in the base directory.

  1. **Static case**: The notebook for these simulations is in [nb_Main.ipynb](nb_Main.ipynb). The methods from [meshes.py](meshes.py), [AnalyticalSolutions.py](AnalyticalSolutions.py) and [NumericalSolutions.py](NumericalSolutions.py) are used in this notebook. 
  2. **Dynamic case**: The simulations for the *Newmark method* are performed in [nb_NewmarkMethod.ipynb](nb_NewmarkMethod.ipynb) and the simulations for the *eigenvalue method* are performed in [nb_EigenvalueMethod.ipynb](nb_EigenvalueMethod.ipynb). Here, additionally, the methods from [DynamicSolutions.py](DynamicSolutions.py) and [Eigenvalues.py](Eigenvalues.py) are used.
* Plots generated by our notebooks can be found in the Report/Figures directory.
* Animations of the dynamic solution and vibration modes can be found in the Report/Animations directory.
* The video presentation can be found in the Presentation folder, [here](Presentation/presentation_video.mp4).
